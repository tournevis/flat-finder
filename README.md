Find flat

A quick project i did to find a flat in Paris. It's based on 'louervite' unofficial Api, and must be improve to communicate with multiple APIs !

Every time it found a flat, it sends you an email with: surface, pictures and price ! 

For the records: I actually find my new place with it ðŸ˜Ž
